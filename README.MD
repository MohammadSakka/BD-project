# Project Repository
Welcome to the project repository! This repository is for the final project of big data course in IU-2023. It contains various components and resources related to my flights delay analysis project. my goal is to leverage big data technologies and advanced analytics to gain insights from flights delay and provide valuable information.

### Project Overview
Flights Delay offer a wealth of information about different delay styles, reasons, in deifferent airports and times

The main objective of this project is to build a comprehensive big data pipeline that ingests, processes, analyzes, and visualizes flights delay data. The pipeline encompasses multiple stages, including data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive data analytics (PDA), and the development of machine learning models for recommendation systems.

### Business Goals
The project aims to achieve the following business goal:

1. Enhance Consumer Experience: By analyzing flights delay data, we can provide flights decisions maker with cutomized recommendations, insights into different delay styles, and overall find the most important delay factor.


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the instructions in the main README file, which provides an overview of the repository's structure and contents. The README files in each folder offer more specific guidance on running scripts, executing queries, and utilizing the provided resources. 

### Folder Structure
- `data`: The data folder should contain the dataset files used in my project.// but it is large size then I put the link to data only
- `hql`: The HQL folder includes Hive query scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `models`: This folder houses the machine learning models implemented in our project.
- `notebooks`: The notebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive data analytics (PDA).
- `scripts`: This folder contains various scripts to assist with data processing, pre-processing, and training.
- `sql`: The SQL folder includes the db.sql file, which contains SQL statements for creating the database and importing the dataset CSV files into it.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control.
- `main.sh`: The main shell script provides a convenient way to execute different stages of the project pipeline.
- `report.pdf`: This file contains the full report of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python packages and their versions for running the project.
